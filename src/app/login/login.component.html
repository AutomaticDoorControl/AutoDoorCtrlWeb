  <p class="lead">The story behind ADC: </p>
<p>Mallory has a disability that requires her to use an assistive device to get around, and she was very frustrated with the poor placement of the automatic door control buttons in public spaces.Being an applied mathematician, she tend to see things in terms of models, and she noticed the poor button placement is dangerous for the user who has to back up while people are walking through.She pitched ADC to RCOS and got a team together in Spring 2019.
